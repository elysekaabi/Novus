        <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
        <p>Novus is an eco-friendly men’s natural body soap business. Located in Seattle, Washington, Novus is a small start-up committed to its mission statement: “To freshen and enhance the world one customer at a time”. What makes Novus unique is that its soap bars are created with organic ingredients and free of any artificial additives. Novus features a wide variety of unique, masculine fragrances containing natural essential oils and fruit extracts. Each scent represents some aspect of nature and the outdoors, targeting male consumers, between the ages of 25 and 44, who are adventurous, driven and environmentally conscious. Research shows that up to 50% of US and European consumers look for natural ingredients such as organic or natural essential oils and fruit extracts and packaging with a natural claim1 . Men aged 18-34 want to take care of themselves but are finding a lack of body care products catered to them. Younger men are shopping for products that go beyond basic hygiene claims, yet only 5% of overall Body & Personal Care product launches in 2018 were aimed at male shoppers . Novus launched its business in response to this need identified in this economic environment. Its target market is located primarily in Washington, and it is hoping to expand to male consumers in other states. The company hopes to portray an image of adventure, developing a reputation to encourage all men to live fearlessly and be confident in whatever challenge that comes next (all while feeling clean and refreshed).</p>
